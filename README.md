# challenge
 - prerequisites: Java 11 and Gradle need to be installed
 - the purpose of this package is to compute the longest and the shortest word in a given sentence
 - the format of the output is the required word(s) and the corresponding length
 - given that a sentence can have multiple words of the same size, the program will output all of them separated by space
 - the program ignores the most common exclamation marks in English as they are not considered words
 - the sentence given as input needs to have at least one word (at least one letter) otherwise the input is rejected
 - to run the tests execute the command "./gradlew clean build --info"
 - to see a report of the executed tests and their status follow the path outputted in the console, for example "Finished generating test html results (0.003 secs) into: /Users/<username>/projects/challenge/build/reports/tests/test
 " (mac OS example)
